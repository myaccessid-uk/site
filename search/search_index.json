What is MyAccessID?","text":"<p>MyAccessID is a federated identity service operated by G\u00c9ANT that lets users log in to computing services by Digital Research Infrastructures (DRI) providers using their home institution credentials (via eduGAIN).  </p> <p>For service providers, it removes the need to operate a login system or manage separate guest accounts. For users, it means a single, trusted login that works across supported research services providers. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#q2-check-institution","title":"Q2. How can I check if my institution supports MyAccessID?","text":"<p>You can check by visiting one of these attribute checker tools: </p> <ul> <li>https://myaccessid.devtest.eduteams.org/sp/</li> <li>https://mms.myaccessid.org/fed-apps/profile/ </li> </ul> <p>Log in using your university credentials and review the attributes (name, surname, email) released. If you can log in successfully and see meaningful attributes, your institution is likely already participating. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#q3-when-and-why","title":"Q3. When and why should a service provider use MyAccessID?","text":"<p>DRI providers often face challenges managing user identities for users coming from across institutions on their systems. Also, if local identities are created, this may lead to unclear affiliations, manual authorisation, offboarding challenges and GDPR hurdles. MyAccessID addresses many of these by offering: </p> <ul> <li>A compliant and consistent identity layer over eduGAIN</li> <li>Simplified OIDC-based integration</li> <li>Enforced minimum attribute profiles </li> <li>A way to avoid running a local IdP or managing guest accounts manually</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s especially useful for services like HPC portals, storage platforms, and other shared national or international infrastructures. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#q4-curremt-UK-sites","title":"Q4.

MyAccessID enforces a usable minimum set and checks for completeness. </p>"},{"location":"faq/#q7-MyAccessID-over-eduGAIN","title":"Q7. Can a service provider connect directly to eduGAIN instead of using MyAccessID?","text":"<p>Technically yes but doing so requires significant effort in configuring trust anchors, handling attribute variability, and maintaining ongoing compliance. MyAccessID offers a managed alternative that abstracts away much of this complexity and is already widely adopted by EuroHPC.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#q8-MyAccessID-attribute-mismatch","title":"Q8.

How are incident response and user trust handled in a federated model like MyAccessID?","text":"<p>Incident response begins with the project PI or the DRI service provider. If a user is flagged (e.g. for misuse or policy breaches), the issue is escalated back to the user\u2019s home institution and/or MyAccessID.
